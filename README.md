# ReciPlease
The hub to connect with other bright culinary thinkers and develop your taste for food! Here at ReciPlease, we inspire users to share their custom made recipes to the world and encourage their peers and ultimately create a lively space to discuss a passion for food. Our application is essentially a social media platform tailored towards the cooking field as posts are limited to recipes and every profile embodies one's food preference. With this project, we will expand the culinary world to more spaces and help individuals discover new past times during their winter hibernations.

### Features:
**Home** appears after logging into the app through which you are presented with the daily trending recipe posts to get a kickstart on what to cook. Each post is structured with the user's profile image and name on the top followed by the name of the dish, an image, the subcategories it falls under, the number of likes, and lastly the recipe to the dish. The subcategories essentially describe the dish through a simple set of labels. 

**Profile** is where you define yourself as a food specialist. It embodies your stance in the cooking field to give your viewers an idea for a good conversation starter prior to meeting you.

**Posting a Recipe** is where the posting aspect comes to play. You will be prompted to make your own recipe by listing the categories it falls under, its name, the ingrediencts, and uploading an image. Upon completion, click publish. 

**Searching for a Recipe** is when you interact with the AI program via Alan AI to acquire recipe recommendations. When you open it, you may wish to ask for recipes that are available through which it will respond the 4 main categories: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. Afterwards, you will be prompted to chose and then the computer will list out the trending meals of that category and ask which in particular you want. Once you respond, it will send you a recipe recommendation automatically and finally terminate.
